Interceptors modify the response returned from a controller, and pass it on to the view, all non-controller specfic tasks like modifying locales, adding common locales must be done by an interceptor, instead of the controller. A controller must only be bothered with the task of collecting data for rendering a page, formatting the data must be done by the interceptor.

          Licensee. The provisions hereof are for the benefit of the parties only and not for any other person or entity.
          Any notice, report, approval, authorization, agreement or consent required or permitted hereunder shall be in

          No failure or delay in exercising any right hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any partial
          exercise of any right or power hereunder preclude further exercise. If any provision shall be adjudged by any
          court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to
          the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and

          supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements and communications relating to the subject
          matter hereof and any waivers or amendments shall be effective only if made in writing. The substantially
          prevailing party in any action to enforce this agreement will be entitled to recover its attorney’s fees and
          costs in connection with such action. As defined in FAR section 2.101, DFAR section 252.227-7014(a)(1)
